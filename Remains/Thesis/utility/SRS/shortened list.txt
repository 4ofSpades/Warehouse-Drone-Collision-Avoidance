--Description--
One rack consists out of pallets on top of specifically-colored bars. Each of these bars thus forms a layer. 
The main goals are:
- Make the drone fly along a bar
- Avoid collisions
- Move between layers

This can be further split up by separating it into the x,y,z position of the drone:
X: Fly sideways, check for collision on side
Y: Keep the bar in the camera view centered, move to unscanned layers
Z: Get distance between the drone and the bar, adjust distance

--Requirements--

shall:
- keep the bar centered
- move right
- keep a distance of at least 50 centimeters from the bar
- check for collidable objects to the right of drone within at least 5 meters
- stop and land to avoid collision with the following objects next to it:
	vehicles
	people
	pallets

should:
- Keep track of the remaining layers needing to be scanned
- Stop at the end of the rack
- move left
- check for collidable objects to the left of drone within at least 5 meters
- Move up one layer

might:
- Detect barcodes on the bar
- Determine whether it should wait or land to avoid collision
- Readjust path to avoid collision
- Move to the other side of the same hallway
- Determine the pixel/distance ratio from the first frame


--Assumptions--
- The drone starts 25-30 centimeters from the bar of the first layer
- The drone starts with the first bar centered in its vision
- There are no objects sticking out more than 10 centimeters from the rack
- The drone will have enough battery capacity for one side of one rack
- The lights in the warehouse are turned on
- The drone is equipped with a RGB camera
- There is at least 2 meters of free space after the end of a bar
- The drone remains connected to the device controlling it
