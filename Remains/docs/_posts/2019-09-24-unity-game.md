## Description
The simulation above generates a drone in a varyingly sized warehouse. With the training the drone to avoid collisions using a to be determined variant of reinforcement learning in mind, this simulation was developed in order to elimate the issues present when training using real drones (e.g. battery life, damage). The version above is human-controllable using the controls described above. NOTE: Loading speeds are not yet optimized, so it might be a short while before anything appears within the black canvas.

## Controls
W -- Move forward  
A -- Move left  
S -- Move back  
D -- Move right  
I -- Ascend  
K -- Descend
