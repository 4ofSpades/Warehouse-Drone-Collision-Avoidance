\label{ch:general}

Here any major changes that are not necessarily directly relevant to one of the (end) products are mentioned here.

\section{Git Pages}
In order to facilitate agile development, a website has been developed using Jekyll and Git Pages. Through this site new builds of the simulation are published with patch notes, as well as other relevant documentation such as a comparison of approaches for collision avoidance.
 
\section{Pivotal Tracker Updates}
Small adjustments were made to the pivotal tracker. These changes mainly occur due to some tasks being obsolete or replaced by other tasks. As the project progresses requirements and feasibility change from their original forms, hence why the Pivotal Tracker should be adjusted accordingly. The new list can be found in appendix \ref{app:table}.

\section{Risk Management}
In order to facilitate risk management, a risk matrix has been made. Each of the risks contains a score, a mitigation action/plan, and a updated score after the mitigation plan has been invoked. The matrix can be found in appendix \ref{app:risks}. %Biggest risk is explained in chapter 4
