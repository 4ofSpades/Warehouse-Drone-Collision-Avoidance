This chapter serves to introduce and describe the background information, context, and stakeholders of this project. A description of the reporting structure is also included.

\section{Background Information}
\label{sec:background}
This project has been assigned as graduation project by Seacon Logistics. The product that will be developed along the course of this semester will ultimately be used to write a thesis on, which is done to satisfy the final requirement set by the \gls{STG2} module. This document specifically exists to fulfill the first requirement of the module, as well as to document the current plan for the project. The latter part is done so that an agreement on what is supposed to be done can be formed on paper.

\section{Context}
\label{sec:context}
"Seacon's mission is to be the Logistics Chain Director, with a focus on overseas logistics, forwarding and distribution and supply chain solutions. Warehousing forms a basis that is linked to the other core services." \cite{About_Seacon} \\\\
\noindent
As the warehouses of Seacon are vital to their business, efficiency and innovation is the key to staying ahead of the competition. This project will form the basis of a larger project with the aim to semi-automatize Inventory Control \& Management of said warehouses.

\section{Stakeholders \& Affiliates}
Within this project, there are 3 groups of stakeholders: The student, Seacon Logistics, and \gls{FHTenL}. The latter 2 groups shall throughout this document be referred to as either "Seacon" or "the company", and "Fontys" or "the university", respectively. The table below lists individual stakeholders, to which group they belong to, and what their roles are.

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem_desc}
Seacon its warehouses contain a lot of storage goods. As part of Inventory Control \& Management, these goods are counted and checked. This is currently done manually by sending out employees to the desired location. As these employees are getting scarcer, Seacon Logistics is looking towards a semi-autonomous solution using drones. According to Seacon, current suppliers are too expensive, do not provide a complete product, and come with a lot of uncertainty among service costs. Moreover, no supplier can guarantee support for 3-10 years, which is a requirement set by Seacon. Hence, Seacon is looking towards developing their own solution by building on open source tools.
